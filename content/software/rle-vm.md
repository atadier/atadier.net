Compilers research project for my exchange semester at UTEC, implementing a tiny stack machine interpreter with a graphical QML debugger.

<!-- more -->

For the first academic semester of 2024, as part of the international mobility program at EPITA, I have travelled abroad to Lima to study at [UTEC](https://utec.edu.pe/en/campus-and-labs), one of the program partner universities, where I enrolled in courses for their *Computer Science* career.

To this end, I was involved in a *Proyecto Preprofesional*, a semester-long running project to implement an interpreter for a stack virtual machine. Our team was under supervision of the dean of computing at the university, and we were tasked with designing and implementing the stack machine for an assembler-like language, as well as a graphical interface to introspect the stack and execution state at runtime.
